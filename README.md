# React Cloud 9 Weather Application

*This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).*

## Purpose 

I created this web application as my final project for the SheCodes Workshops React Development course. This weather application can be used for checking the current weather information (temperature, humidity, and wind speed) and 3-hour forecast in a given city in either metric or imperial units.
